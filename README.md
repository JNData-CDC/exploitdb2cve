# exploitdb2cve
Creates a mapping of `{edbid  => [CVE1 CVE2 ... CVEn]}`.

Useful (I hope) when you know the CVE and would like to find an exploit for it, *without* getting the whole ExploitDB repo.

## Tip
If you want to clone ExploitDB repo into this project, use `_git` sub-directory, as it's in `.gitignore`.
