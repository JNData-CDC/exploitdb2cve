# exploitdb2cve
Creates a mapping of {edbid  => [CVE1 CVE2 ... CVEn]}.

Useful (I hope) when you know the CVE and would like to find an exploit for it, *without* getting the whole ExploitDB repo.

## TODO
- add exploitdb repo HEAD hash and commit timestamp to JSON,
- make 'exploit_db_path' optional, and if not provided, clone exploitdb repo into './exploitdb',
- in case of using embedded exploitdb repo, do a 'git pull' before generating the mappings,
