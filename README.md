# exploitdb2cve
Creates a mapping of `{edbid  => [CVE1 CVE2 ... CVEn]}`.

I'm using this mapping on a system, which needs to be able to tell if there is a publicly known exploit
for a given CVE, but I can't download the full ExploitDB there.

## Usage
```
$ ./edb2cve.py --help
usage: edb2cve.py [-h] [-o OUTPUT] exploit_db_path

Generate mapping: EDBID => CVEs

positional arguments:
  exploit_db_path       ExploitDB repo path (will clone, if doesn't exist)

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -o OUTPUT, --output OUTPUT
                        (json) output file path

```
## Tips
* If there's no local copy of the ExploitDB in the `exploit_db_path`, the tool will do the `git clone`.
* If you're pointing out to an existing ExploitDB clone, you're responsible for it being up to date.
* If you want to clone ExploitDB repo into this project, use `_workdir/exploitdb` sub-directory, as it's in `.gitignore`.
